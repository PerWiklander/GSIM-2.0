* **Definition**

| **Class** | **Group** | **Definition** | **Explanatory Text** | **Synonyms** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Administrative Details | Base | extensions to the model based on an organisation's administrative needs | The _Administrative Details_ is designed to act as a 'placeholder' to allow for future extensions to the existing model. It allows for further information to be added about the _Administrative Details_ required to maintain the other information classes outlined by GSIM. |   |

* **Attributes**

| **Name** | **Description** | **Cardinality** | **Value Type** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### 2.2 Descriptive Information
**Business Group**  is used to capture the designs and plans of statistical programmes, and the processes undertaken to deliver those programmes.

The information classes defined within this group as as follows:

#### **Assessment**

**Definition**

| **Class** | **Group** | **Definition** | **Explanatory Text** | **Synonyms** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assessment | Business | result of the analysis of the quality and effectiveness of any activity undertaken by a statistical organisation and recommendations on how these can be improved | An _Assessmen_t can be of a variety of types. One example may include a gap analysis, where a current state is determined along with what is needed to reach its target state. Alternatively, an _Assessment_ may compare current processes against a set of requirements, for example a new _Statistical Need_ or change in the operating environment.An _Assessment_ can use various classes as inputs, whether they are the main classes that the _Assessment_ is about or auxiliary classes that help accomplish the _Assessment_. |

| Business Case | Business | proposal for a body of work that will deliver outputs designed to achieve outcomes | A _Business Case_ is produced as a result of a detailed consideration of a _Change Definition_. It sets out a plan for how the change described by the _Change Definition_ can be achieved. A _Business Case_ usually comprises various evaluations. The _Business Case_ will specify the stakeholders that are impacted by the _Statistical Need_ or by the different solutions that are required to implement it.A _Business Case_ will provide the reasoning for undertaking a_ Statistical Support Activity _to initiate a new _Statistical Programme Design_ for an existing _Statistical Programme,_ or an entirely new _Statistical Programme_, as well as the details of the change proposed. |

| Business Function | Business | activities undertaken by a statistical organisation to achieve its objectives | A _Business_ _Function_ delivers added value from a business point of view. It is delivered by bringing together people, processes and technology (resources), for a specific business purpose._Business Functions_ answer in a generic sense "What business purpose does this _Business Service _or_ Process Step_ serve?" (c.f. Business Process answers the question of "How?"). Through identifying the _Business Function_ associated with each _Business Service _or_ Process Step, _it increases the documentation of the use of the associated _Business Services_ and _Process Steps_, to enable future reuse.A _Business Function_ may be defined directly with descriptive text and/or through reference to an existing catalogue of _Business Functions_. The phases and sub-processes defined within GSBPM can be used as an internationally agreed basis for cataloguing high-level _Business Functions_. A catalogue might also include _Business Functions_ defined at a lower level than "sub-process". For example, "Identify and address outliers" might be catalogued as a lower level _Business Function_ with the "Review and validate" function (5.3) defined within GSBPM. |

The operation of a _Business Service_ will perform one or more _Business Processes_.The explicitly defined interface of a _Business Service_ can be seen as representing a "service contract". If particular inputs are provided then the service will deliver particular outputs in compliance within specific parameters (for example, within a particular period of time).Note: The interface of a _Business Service_ is not necessarily IT based. For example, a typical postal service will have a number of service interfaces:
- Public letter box for posting letters

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Change Definition | Business | structured, well-defined specification for a proposed change | A related class - the _Statistical Need_ - is a change expression as it has been received by an organisation. A _Statistical Need_ is a raw expression of a proposed change, and is not necessarily well-defined. A _Change Definition_ is created when a _Statistical Need_ is analysed by an organisation, and expresses the raw need in well-defined, structured terms.A _Change Definition_ does not assess the feasibility of the change or propose solutions to deliver the change - this role is satisfied by the _Business Case_ class. The precise structure or organisation of a _Change Definition_ can be further specified by rules or standards local to a given organisation. It also includes the specific_ Concepts_ to be measured and the _Population_ that is under consideration.Once a _Statistical Need_ has been received, the first step is to do the conceptual work to establish what it is we are trying to measure. The final output of this conceptual work is the _Change Definition._The next step is to assess how we are going to make the measurements - to design a solution and put forward a proposal for a body of work that will deliver on the requirements of the original _Statistical Need_. |

| Core Input | Business | essential input for the _Process Step Instance_ | Core _Input_ is a sub-type of _Process Input_. Producers of official statistics often conceptualise data (and sometimes metadata) flowing through the statistical _Business Process_, having statistical value added by each _Process Step_.The concept of Core _Input_ allows this notional flow of information through the production process to be traced, without confusing these inputs with other inputs - such as _Parameter Inputs_ and _Process Support Inputs_ that are controlling or influencing a particular _Process Step_ but do not "flow through the _Business Process_" in the same sense. Typical Core _Inputs_ are _Data Sets_ and structural metadata.  |

The possible paths, and the decision criteria, associated with a _Process Control_ are specified as part of designing a production process, captured in a _Process Control Design_. There is typically a very close relationship between the design of a process and the design of a _Process Control_. |

#### **Process Control Design**

**Definition**

| **Class** | **Group** | **Definition** | **Explanatory Text** | **Synonyms** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Process Control Design | Business | specification of the decision points required during the execution of a _Business Process_ | The design of a _Process Control_ typically takes place as part of the design of the process itself. This involves determining the conditional routing between the various sub-processes and services used by the executing process associated with the _Process_ _Control _and specified by the _Process Control Design._It is possible to define a _Process Control_ where the next step in the_ Process Step_ that will be executed is a fixed value rather than a "choice" between two or more possibilities. Where such a design would be appropriate, this feature allows, for example, initiation of a step in the  _Process Step_ representing the GSBPM Process Phase (5) to always lead to initiation of GSBPM sub-process Integrate Data (5.1) as the next step.This allows a process designer to divide a _Business Process_ into logical steps (for example, where each step performs a specific _Business Function_ through re-use of a _Business Service_) even if these Process Steps will always follow each other in the same order. In all cases, the _Process Control_ _Design_ defines and the _Process Control_ manages the flow between _Process Steps_, even where the flow is "trivial". _Process Design _is left to focus entirely on the design of the process itself, not sequencing between steps. |

| Process Design | Business | specification of each _Process Step_ and description of their arrangement in a _Business Process_ needed to perform a _Business Function_ | A _Process Design_ is the design time specification of a _Process Step_ that is performed as part of a run-time _Business Service_. A _Process Step_ can be as big or small as the designer of a particular _Business Service_ chooses. From a design perspective, one _Process Step_ can contain "sub-steps", each of which is conceptualised as a (smaller) _Process Step_ in its own right. Each of those "sub-steps" may contain "sub-steps" within them and so on. It is a decision for the process designer to what extent to subdivide steps. At some level it will be appropriate to consider a _Process Step_ to be a discrete task without warranting further subdivision. At that level the _Process Step_ is designed to process particular _Process Inputs,_ according to a particular_ Process Method_, to produce particular _Process Output_s. The flow between a _Process Step _and any sub steps is managed via _Process Control_. |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Process Metric | Business | _Process Output_ summarising some aspect or property of the execution | A _Process Metric_ is a sub-type of _Process Output_ which records information about the execution of a _Process Step_. For example, how long it took to complete execution of the _Process Step_ and what percentage of records in the Core _Input_ was updated by the _Process Step_ to produce the Core_Output_.One purpose for a _Process Metric_ may be to provide a quality measure related to the Core_ Output_. For example, a _Process Step_ with the _Business Function_ of imputing missing values is likely to result, as its Core_Output_, in a _Data Set_ where values that were missing previously have been imputed. Statistical quality measures, captured as _Process Metrics_ for that _Process Step_ may include a measure of how many records were imputed, and a measure of how much difference, statistically, the imputed values make to the dataset overall which can be also used as a part of a quality report associated with the Data Set produced. Another purpose for a _Process Metric_ may be to measure an aspect of the _Process Step_ which is not directly related to the Core_Output_ it produced. For example, a _Process Metric_ may record the time taken to complete the _Process Step_ or other forms of resource utilisation (for example, human and/or IT).Often these two kinds of _Process Metrics_ will be used in combination when seeking to, for example, monitor and tune a statistical _Business Process_ so its statistical outputs achieve the highest level of quality possible based on the time, staff and/or IT resources that are available. |

Reuse of _Process Patterns _can indicate the possibility_ _to reuse related _Business Services._By deciding to reuse a _Process Pattern_, a designer is actually reusing the pattern of _Process Designs_ and _Process Control Designs_ associated with that _Process Pattern_. They will receive a new instance of the Proce_ss Designs_ and _Process Control Designs_. If they then tailor their "instance" of the _Process Designs_ and _Process Control Designs_ to better meet their needs they will not change the definition of the reusable _Process Pattern_. |

| Statistical Programme | Business | set of activities to produce statistics on a given_ Universe_ within the context of_ Subject Fields_ | The _Statistical Programme_ provides the environmental context in which activities to produce statistics within a statistical organisation are conducted. _Statistical Programme_ will usually correspond to an ongoing activity such as a survey or output series covered by GSBPM phase 4-7. Some examples of _Statistical Programme_ are:
- Labour Force Survey
- Multipurpose Household Survey
- National Accounts
- Demography
- Overseas Arrivals and Departures
Related to the _Statistical Programme_ class, there are _Statistical Programme Design_ and _Statistical Programme Cycle_ classes that hold the detailed information about the design and conduct of the _Business Process_. A _Statistical Programme_ could take as inputs other _Statistical Programmes'_ outputs, e.g. national accounts. These activities are all carried out to generate _Products_.In the case of the traditional approach, an organisation has received a _Statistical Need_ and produced a _Change Definition_ and an approved _Business Case_. The _Business Case_ will specify either a change to the design or methodology of an existing _Statistical Programme_, which will result in a new _Statistical Programme Design_; or a change to one or more existing _Statistical Programmes_ (for example, to add an additional objective to the _Statistical Programme_); or result in a new _Statistical Programme_ being created.This does not include statistical support functions such as metadata management, data management (and other overarching GSBPM processes) and design functions. These activities are conducted as part of _Statistical Support Activity_. |

| Statistical Programme Design | Business | specification of the set of activities undertaken to investigate characteristics of a given _Population_ | The _Statistical Programme Design _takes into account requirements such as resource, policy and compliance, specifies new processes, the use of existing ones and the description of relevant methodological information about that set of activities. It is a series of classes that provide the operational context in which a set of _Business Processes_ is conducted. A simple example is where a _Statistical Programme _relates to a single survey, for example, the Labour Force Survey. The _Statistical Programme _will have a series of _Statistical Programme Design _classes that describe the methodology and design used throughout the life of the survey. When a methodological change is made to the survey, a new _Statistical Programme Design_ is created to record the details of the new design. |

### 3.2 Descriptive Information
**Concept Group**  is used to define the meaning of information to provide an understanding of what the data are measuring.

The information classes defined within this group as as follows:

#### **Category**

**Definition**

| **Class** | **Group** | **Definition** | **Explanatory Text** | **Synonyms** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Category | Concept | _Concept_ whose role is to extensionally define and measure a characteristic     | _Categories _for the _Concept_ of sex include: Male, FemaleNote: An extensional definition is a description of a _Concept_ by enumerating all of its subordinate _Concepts_ under one criterion or sub-division.For example - the Noble Gases (in the periodic table) are extensionally defined by the set of elements including Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, Radon. (ISO 1087-1) | class |

| Classification Index | Concept | ordered list (e.g. alphabetical, in code order) of _Classification Index Entries_ | A _Classification Index_ shows the relationship between text found in statistical data sources (responses to survey questionnaires, administrative records) and one or more _Statistical Classifications_.  A _Classification Index_ may be used to assign the codes for _Classification Items_ to observations in acquisitions of statistical data.A _Statistical Classification_ is a subtype of _Node Set_. The relationship between _Statistical Classification_ and _Classification Index_ can also be extended to include the other _Node Set_ types - _Code List_ and _Category Set_.
 A _Classification Index_ can relate to one particular or to several _Statistical Classifications_. |
 |

**Attributes\***

| **Name** | **Description** | **Cardinality** | **Value Type** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Coding Instructions  | Additional information which drives the coding process for all entries in a _Classification Index_. | 0..\*   | String |
| Corrections | Summary description of corrections, which have occurred within the _Classification Index_. Corrections include changing the item code associated with a _Classification Index Entry_. | 0..1 | String |
| Languages Available | A _Classification Index_ can exist in several languages. Indicates the languages available. If a _Classification Index_ exists in several languages, the number of entries in each language may be different, as the number of terms describing the same phenomenon can change from one language to another. However, the same phenomena should be described in each language. | 0..\* | String |

\* Attributes inherited from super-type(s) are not included here

_Presentation_ can be in different forms; e.g. tables, graphs, structured data files. Examples:
- A table of data. Based on a _DataSet_, the related _Data Structure_ is used to label the column and row headings for the table. The _Data Set_ is used to populate the cells in the table. Reference metadata is used to populate footnotes and cell notes on the table. Confidentiality rules are applied to the _Data Set_ to suppress any disclosive cells.
- A data file based on a standard (e.g. SDMX).
- A PDF document describing a _Statistical Classification_.
- Any structural metadata object expressed in a standard format (e.g. DDI 3.1 XML).

| Product | Exchange | package of content that can be disseminated as a whole      | A _Product_ packages _Information Sets_ for an _Information Consumer_. The _Product_ is generated according to _Output Specifications_, which define how the information from the_ Information Sets _are presented (via Presentations)  to the _Information Consumer_.A _Provision Agreement_ between the statistical organisation and the _Information Consumer_ governs the use of a _Product_ by the _Information Consumer_. The _Provision Agreement,_ which may be explicitly or implicitly agreed, provides the legal or other bases by which the two parties agree to exchange data. In many cases, dissemination _Provision Agreements_ are implicit in the terms of use published by the statistical organisation.For static _Products_ (e.g. paper publications), specifications are predetermined. For dynamic _Products_, aspects of specification could be determined by the_ Information Consumer_ at run time. Both cases result in _Output Specifications_ specifying _Information Set_ data or referential metadata that will be included within the _Product_. |

| Question | Exchange | text used to elicit a response for a _Conceptual Variable_     | A _Question_ may be a single question used to obtain a response, or may be a multiple question, a construct which links multiple sub-questions, each with their own response.A _Question_ also includes a relationship to the _Value Domain_ to document the associated response criteria for the question. A single response question will have one _Value Domain_ associated with it, while a 'multiple question' may have more than one _Value Domain_.A _Question_ should be designed with re-use in mind, as it can be used in multiple _Questionnaires._In a national implementation,_ Question _could be further subtyped into_: _
- QuestionGrid, useful to model questions as grids/tables. It is actually a cube-like structure providing dimension information, labelling options, and response domains attached to one or more cells within the grid. For instance, a two-way table requesting to provide turnovers broken down by affiliates.
- QuestionItem, a simple question that is necessarily one dimensional. For example: "How old are you?"

| Register | Exchange | written and complete record containing regular entries of items and details on particular sets of objects | In official statistics, "statistical registers" and "adminisitrative registers" (registers maintained by other organisations, usually administrative data owners) are usually distinguished. In GSIM, the information class "Register" is used to describe both types because the attributes are more or less the same so from the information management point of view, they can be handled as one GSIM class.There is usually a purpose or authority for maintaining the _Register _and each object in the _Register _is described using a pre-defined set of characteristics. Examples include business and population registers as used by statistical organisations. Therefore, from statistical perspective, the _Register _can be interpreted as a set of objects for a given _Population_, updated on a regular basis, containing information on identification, accessibility of _Units _and other attributes. The _Register _contains the current and historical statuses of the _Population _and the causes, effects and sources of alterations in the _Population_.In order to better understand how the _Register _is used in GSIM, the use cases for the different scenarios are explained. These scenarios are:
- _Register _as_ Information Set_ maintained and regularly updated by the statistical organisation.
- _Register _as_ Information Set_ for survey frames/sample frames.
- _Register _as_ Information Set_ for statistical _Products_.
- _Register _as_ Information Set_ used as direct or auxiliary information for the production of statistics.
- _Register _as_ Information Set_  as a source of administrative information obtained usually from external organisations.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attribute Component | Structure | role given to a _Represented Variable_ in the context of a _Data Structure, _which supplies information other than identification or measures     | For example:
- the embargo time (at which point the observation will be made publicly available)
- the base period of the data in the series
 |
 |

**Attributes\***

| **Name** | **Description** | **Cardinality** | **Value Type** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
